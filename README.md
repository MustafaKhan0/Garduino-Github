# Garduino-Github

Garduino is a project which aims to create an automatic irrigation system which uses moisture levels in the soil to determine whether or not to water the plants. 

This is inspired by an automatic system made by an FLL team at Hommocks Middle School, and the automatic system made by practical engineering. However, our design rational focuses on simplicity and deployment more than other approaches. 
It was also build by then middle school students, who aimed to learn more about coding, CAD, system design, and engineering in the real world while having fun. 
It is currently a work in progress. Reach out if you'd like more information!
